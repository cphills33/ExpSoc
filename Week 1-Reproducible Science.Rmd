## Write down everytime someone is surprised

## When are we surprised?
> - When an assumption is violated

## What is a p-value?
> - A p-value represents how surprising the data is, assuming the null hypothesis is true

## What is a p-value?
> - A p-value represents how surprising the data is, assuming the null hypothesis is true
> - **Null hypothesis:** Harry is not a wizard
> - **Alternative hypothesis:** Harry is a wizard
> - **Data**: Hagrid told Harry he is a wizard. 
> - Should we reject the null hypothesis? How surprising is this data, assuming Harry is not a wizard.

## What is a p-value?
> - A p-value represents how surprising the data is, assuming the null hypothesis is true
> - A p-value is significant when it is less than .05
> - In your mind, switch the word ‘significant’ to ‘surprising, assuming the null hypothesis is true’
> - A p-value is the probability of seeing data as or more extreme than the current data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

## My p-value is less than .05
- Does this mean there is a 95% probability the alternative hypothesis is true?

## What is a p-value?
> - A p-value represents how surprising the data is, assuming the null hypothesis is true
> - Scientists use an alpha level to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. It is usually set to p < .05.
> - This does not mean there is a 95% chance the alternative hypothesis is correct.
> - In fact, we never know if we were correct in rejecting the null hypothesis.
> - We just know that in the long run if we set our alpha level to p < .05, we’ll never be wrong more than 5% of the time.

## Flip a coin!
- Or ask your phone to

## What is an effect size?
> - The magnitude of an effect

## Are women more extraverted than men?
<img class = "fullimagewidth" src="cohens d extroversion.png" width="700">

## Do women report more negative affect than men?
<img class = "fullimagewidth" src="cohens d negative affect.png" width="700">

## Are women more agreeable than men?
<img class = "fullimagewidth" src="cohens d agreeableness.png" width="700">

## Think-Pair-Share
- **Are women better coders than men?**
- Break into groups of 4-6
- Write your names and n-numbers on a piece of paper
- **Women are better coders than men: p < .05, d = .04**
- Imagine a man and a woman have applied to be a coder for your business. Would you automatically hire the woman? How much more likely would you want a randomly selected woman to be better at coding before you would use gender as a basis for hiring a coder?
- Once your group has reached consensus, hand in your answers to the three questions.

## What is statistical power?
> - Assuming the null hypothesis is false, what is the probability the p-value will be less than .05?

## What is statistical power?
> - Assuming the null hypothesis is false, what is the probability the p-value will be less than .05?
> - related to effect size and sample size
> - Statistical power increases when you have a larger sample
> - Statistical power increases when you have a larger effect
> - Rule of thumb is to aim for 80% power

## P-values and sample sizes
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

- Group A: M = 100
- Group B: M = 106
- (there is a real difference between these 2 groups)
- 20 participants in each group
- What is the p-value?

## What does a p-value tell us?

## Optional Stopping
<div style="float: left; width: 50%;">

- This is a how a p-value changes as you add more participants.

- This represents the case where the null hypothesis is true.

</div>

## What does a p-value tell us?
- To answer this we need to know:
    - How many tests conducted
    - How many participants

## QRPs, HARKING, and P-Hacking
QRP
:    Questionable Research Practice

- Almost 1/4 of American Psycholgists have used a QRP in the last 12 months (<https://psyarxiv.com/3v7hx/>)

HARKING
:    Hypothesizing after results known  


p-hacking
:    another phrase to describe a questionable research practice but usually with a focus on obtaining a significant p-value

## Preregistration

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LYfZr5poCkQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Preregistration
- Register details of a study beforehand so you don’t exercise researcher degrees of freedom later
- Design
- Sample size/Stopping rule
- Analysis Plan and exclusion rules

## External Validity
- The extent to which results of a study can be generalized to other populations and settings
- Exact replication: generalize to other labs
- Conceptual replication: generalize to other operationalizations of variables
- Other populations
- Other experimenters
- Replication plus extension: researchers replicate original study but add variables to test additional questions

## Replication vs. Reproduction
Replication
:    If I re-run your experiment, do I get the same results?

- About 35% of Social Psychology experiments replicate

Reproduction
:    If I re-analyze your data, do I get the same results?

In the journal cognition:

- About 78% of data is available to be re-analyzed
- About 60% of data is actually usable
- Of 35 articles selected for a test:
    - 11 could be reproduced
    - 11 more could be reproduced with help from the authors
    - 13 articles  not be reproduced even with author help

## Ego Depletion
> - Willpower is like a muscle. It gets tired as you use it. So you have less willpower and doing a task that requires willpower.
> - Haggar et al., 2010: Meta-analysis of 83 studies finds evidence for ego depletion (d = .63—medium)
> - Carter & McCullough (2014): Another meta-analysis but correcting for small study effects (d = 0)
> - Haggar et al., 2016: Many labs study (23 labs), 2141 participants. Ego depletion is a small effect (d ~= 0).

## Open Science

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1rFWeTryiW4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Open Science

- Benefits:
    - This is what people think science is anyway
    - make science more democratic and more meritocratic
    
- Solves:
    - More people can be involved. More collaboration, more sharing of data and materials
    - helps science to self-correct
    
- Cons:
    - Takes more time initially
    - (but saves time in the long run by making data and materials available)

## What makes a study convincing?
> - low p-value?
> - No QRPs, p-hacking, or HARKING
> - open science practices
> - replication
> - reproducibility
> - construct, internal, external, and statistical validity
